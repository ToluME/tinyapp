# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web app built with Node.js and Express framework that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). The app will allow users to shorten long URLs much like TinyURL.com and bit.ly do.

## Features
* Create shortened URLs for long URLs
* Store the mapping of shortened URLs to their corresponding long URLs
* View and manage the list of created URLs
* Redirect users to the original long URL when accessing the shortened URL
* User authentication and login/logout functionality

## Getting Started
Dependencies:
* Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment
* Express - Web framework for Node.js
* EJS - Embedded JavaScript templating
* cookie-parser - Cookie parsing middleware

Usage:
* Open your web browser and access the application at http://localhost:8080.
* Log in with a new username or an existing one.
* After logging in, you will be able to create shortened URLs for long URLs.
* Manage your URLs by viewing, editing, or deleting them.
* Access the shortened URLs to be redirected to the original long URLs.
